Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies,Medication Administration,Multiple Choice,No,Medium,"A healthcare provider orders digoxin 0.125mg PO daily for a client. Before administering the medication, the nurse must check the client's apical pulse. What is the minimum apical pulse rate at which the nurse should administer this medication?","60 beats/minute","50 beats/minute","70 beats/minute","80 beats/minute","","(1)","Option 1 is correct. The minimum apical pulse rate for administering digoxin is 60 beats/minute. If the pulse is below this rate, the medication should be withheld and the healthcare provider notified due to the risk of bradycardia.","Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. A pulse rate below 60 beats/minute is too low for safe digoxin administration, while waiting for higher rates (70 or 80) is unnecessary and may delay needed therapy.","Burchum, J., & Rosenthal, L. (2022). Lehne's pharmacology for nursing care (11th ed.). Chapter 32: Cardiac Glycosides"
Safety and Infection Control,Standard Precautions,Select All That Apply,Yes,Hard,"A nurse is caring for multiple clients on a medical-surgical unit. Which actions should the nurse implement to prevent the spread of infection? Select all that apply.","Perform hand hygiene before and after each client contact","Wear the same pair of gloves when providing care to multiple clients","Place used needles in the appropriate sharps container","Reuse personal protective equipment (PPE) to conserve supplies","Wear a mask when within 3 feet of a client with influenza","(1, 3, 5)","Options 1, 3, and 5 are correct. Hand hygiene is the most effective way to prevent infection transmission. Used needles must be disposed of in sharps containers immediately after use. Wearing a mask when caring for clients with respiratory infections helps prevent droplet transmission.","Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. Gloves must be changed between clients to prevent cross-contamination. PPE should never be reused as this can spread pathogens between clients and compromise infection control measures.","CDC. (2023). Standard Precautions for All Patient Care. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines"
Health Promotion and Maintenance,Health Screening,Multiple Choice,No,Easy,"A nurse is teaching a 50-year-old woman about breast cancer screening. According to current guidelines, how often should the client receive a screening mammogram?","Every 6 months","Every year","Every 2 years","Every 5 years","","(2)","Option 2 is correct. Current guidelines recommend annual mammograms for women aged 45-54 years. Women aged 40-44 have the option to start annual screening, and women 55 and older can switch to every 2 years or continue yearly screening.","Options 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. Screening every 6 months is too frequent and not evidence-based. Every 2 or 5 years is too infrequent for this age group and could delay early detection.","American Cancer Society. (2023). Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines"
Psychosocial Integrity,Crisis Intervention,Multiple Choice,Yes,Medium,"A client in the emergency department is experiencing an acute panic attack. Which intervention should the nurse implement first?","Administer an anti-anxiety medication","Speak to the client in a calm, reassuring voice","Call for a psychiatric consultation","Place the client in a quiet, private room","","(2)","Option 2 is correct. Speaking calmly and reassuringly is the first step in helping a client during a panic attack. This intervention helps establish trust and can begin de-escalating the situation immediately without requiring additional orders or resources.","Options 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. Medication requires a provider's order and should not be the first intervention. A psychiatric consultation may be needed but is not the immediate priority. Moving the client to a private room may be helpful but should not be done before establishing communication.","Varcarolis, E. M. (2022). Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing (4th ed.). Chapter 12: Anxiety and Related Disorders"
Basic Care and Comfort,Nutrition and Oral Hydration,Select All That Apply,No,Medium,"A nurse is caring for a client with dysphagia. Which interventions should the nurse implement to promote safe oral intake? Select all that apply.","Position the client in a 90-degree upright position for meals","Encourage the client to eat quickly to prevent fatigue","Provide thin liquids to prevent dehydration","Place food on the unaffected side of the mouth","Check for pocketing of food after meals","(1, 4, 5)","Options 1, 4, and 5 are correct. Proper positioning reduces the risk of aspiration. Placing food on the unaffected side helps with control and swallowing. Checking for pocketing ensures food is properly cleared from the mouth.","Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. Eating quickly increases aspiration risk. Thin liquids are more difficult to control and increase aspiration risk; thickened liquids are often prescribed for dysphagia.","Potter, P. A., & Perry, A. G. (2021).
