You are an AI coding assistant.  
Task: Read the JSON file at `schema_export.json`, convert it into a Markdown database schema reference (tables grouped by category, then table_name, with columns “Name | Type | Description”), and write the result to `docs/db_schema.md`.  
Output must be valid Markdown.  
Always overwrite the entire file.  
No explanation — only output the full contents of the Markdown file.
